<li class="stark"><b>The North - Ruled by House Stark</b></li>
	<img src="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/c/cc/King_Who_Knelt.jpg" width="800px" height="300px"></ul>
<p>The Starks are the oldest house in Westeros amongst the current houses at the start of the series. They can trace their lineage back to the First Men and Brandon the Builder from the Age of Heroes, who according to legend built Winterfell and founded House Stark. He also built the Wall, presumably after the Long Night when the White Walkers invaded Westeros. Winterfell was built over a hot spring that pumped heat through the walls to help them survive the long, brutal winters. It's left for debate whether the Children of the Forest gave the First Men the territory to build Winterfell as part of the Pact, or if the First Men were successful in taking the land and forced the Children to surrender but I'll cover that in more depth in another article. </p>

<p>The Starks are known for being secluded from the rest of the realm. They tend to stick to their own territory, are known for being cold and at times wild which is referred to as having "Wolf Blood". They worship the Old Gods which involves the practice of worshiping Weirwood trees and arguably blood magic in some ways. In the books the Stark children have a magical connection with their direwolves which allows them to enter the minds of animals and see through their eyes which is known as warging. The Stark children's warging suggests that Starks of previous generations shared this connection as well. For Bran it was most obvious from his wolf dreams and guidance from the 3 Eyed Crow. Jon and Arya have wolf dreams as well, Sansa and Robb however do not. Sansa's wolf died early in the series so she lost her magical connection. Robb doesn't have a POV chapter so we'll never know for certain but you could argue that his skill as a commander in battle was due to the fact his direwolf was showing him secret paths to give strategical advances on his enemies.</p>

<p>The North is the last remaining kingdom of the First Men. They withstood the Andal invasion from the south not only because it's the largest kingdom and required a great army to do so, but because of the strategical position of Moat Cailin at the Neck (the small track of land that connects the north to the main body of Westeros). The Andals were pushed back south but were able to conquer the remaining kingdoms. It wasn't until The Targaryens arrived and destroyed the Andal kings. When word reached the King of the North at the time of Aegon's conquest, Torrhen Stark, that the dragon king meant to advance North he knew his people could not withstand the power of 3 dragons. Torrhen went south to meet Aegon and bent the knee to save his people from certain death. He was forever remembered as "The King who Knelt" and was sworn in as Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. The Wardens of the North were charged with defending the North and assisting the Nights Watch when necessary. It didn't happen often but whenever a King Beyond the Wall grew too powerfull and threatened the peace the Starks helped defend the Wall. The Stark sigil is a grey direwolf on a field of white and their words are "Winter is Coming".</p>

  <li class="vale"><b>The Vale - Ruled by House Arryn</b></li>

   <p>The Arryns were some of the first Andals to arrive in Westeros and can trace their lineage to the oldest and purest line of Andal nobility. The King of the Vale at the time of the Andal invasion was able to unite the First Men and hold off the lesser Andal kings for a time until Ser Artys Arryn, also known as the Falcon Knight came of age. He united the Andal forces against the First Men and defeated the Mountain King. the remaining houses bent the knee to House Arryn. The First Men who did not embrace Artys as their king were driven into the mountains and formed clans. The descendants of these clans would eventually join Tyrion on the promise that he would give them the Vale of Arryn back in season 1. 
    <p>The Vale is located on the eastern coast of Westeros just south of the Neck. It's so far removed from the Kingsroad(the fastest route through Westeros) the only way to get there is by accessing the High Road that passes through the Mountains of the Moon where the mountain clans prove to be dangerous. The clans had what weapons and armor they could find during their raids on unsuspecting travelers but Tywin equiped the clans with castle forged steel. They grew more bold on their return to the mountains after they were dismissed from Kings Landing. The Vale stronghold is considered the most secure in Westeros because it consists of a 3 layer defense. First the Bloody Gate which protects the Highroad from any approaching army or clan. Second is the Gates of the Moon, the first seat of House Arryn when they took the Vale from the First Men. It sits at the base of the tallest mountain in the Vale and they eventually built the Eyrie (pictured left) at it's summit. The Gates of the Moon is the seat of the Arryns during the winter but during the remaining seasons they live in the Eyrie. It was considered impregnable until the dragons allowed the Targaryens to launch a direct assault at the Eyrie, bypassing the lower defenses. The Arryns swore fealty and were sworn in as Lords of the Vale and Warden of the East.</p>  
    <p>The Arryns are a proud family, known for their honor and a strong tradition of knighthood as the Knights of the Vale. In the series the Vale is secluded from the wars for a time being on account of Lysa's paranoia of the Lannisters. You might remember the sky cells from the show that look out over the mountains. Prisoners can leave at their peril, or if they are found guilty of their crimes, leave through the moon door. The Knights of the Vale prove their worth during the Battle of the Bastards and provide enough reinforcements to take back Winterfell. The sigil of House Arryn is a soaring blue falcon against a white moon on a field of blue. Their words are "As High as Honor".</p>
   <li class="grey"><b>The Iron Islands - Ruled by House Greyjoy</b></li>

   <p>When it comes to the lore and mythology of the kingdoms of Westeros, the Ironborn and House Greyjoy  have the most interesting stories in my opinion. The Greyjoys can trace their lineage back to the First Men and the Age of Heroes when the Grey King ruled the Iron Islands. According to legend the Grey King took a mermaid to wife and slew the great sea dragon Nagga, who feasted on krakens and could drown islands. The Grey King built his throne from her jaw, her teeth became his crown and her bones were his halls where he ruled for 1000 years so they say. In the end the Grey King walked into the sea to sit at the right hand of the drowned god in his watery hall.</p>
   <p>The Ironborn descended from the First Men but they did not share their practice of worshiping the Old gods likely because there were no Children of the Forest on the Iron Islands to teach them about the gods nor were Weirwood trees able to grow on their land. Instead they worshiped their own god, Drowned God, and developed their own customs of reaving and raiding the Western shores of Westeros. The King of the Iron Islands was not decided by a bloodline but was chosen by the people kingsmoot, the people cast their vote on Nagga's Hill where the sea dragons bones still stand. These kings were referred to as Driftwood kings because their crowns were made of driftwood. Eventually the kingsmoot was abolished by an eventual king of House Greyiron and he established his descendants as successors known as the Iron Kings for their iron crowns. The Iron Kings destroyed any house that oppossed their rule which caused tension amongst the Iron Islands and the Kings of mainland Westeros took advantage of their squabbles before the Andals arrived.</p>
   <p>The Andals made a pact with some of the the lesser houses and brought an end to the Iron Kings. The ironborn intermarried with the Andal invaders and House Hoare was chosen to rule the Iron Islands. Many of the devout worshipers of the drowned god were against the Hoares because they took Andal queens and began following the Faith of the Seven. The Hoare kings abandoned reaving and raiding for trade and the Iron Islands prospered. Centuries later, the King Harwyn Hardhand launched an assault on mainland Westeros and took the Riverlands from the Storm Kings. Harwyn's grandson Harren rose to king in years to come and built the castle known as Harrenhal. You might remember the castle from season 2 where Arya is taken prisoner and forced to be Tywin's cupbearer. The construction of the castle took 40 years to complete, built to be the greatest and tallest castle in Westeros. On the final day of construction, when the last brick was laid, Aegon began his war against the 7 kingdoms. Aegon offered Harren peace if he bent the knee but Harren refused, so Aegon burnt the castle with dragonfire so hot the stone towers melted into themselves. Harren was well known as a tyrant and did not inspire loyalty among his vassals. Chief among them were the Tullys who joined Aegon's cause and inspired the other river lords to follow suit. Harren and all his sons burned alive and the Tullys were granted the Riverlands as a reward. The Ironborn that remained fled back to the Iron Islands, but Aegon gave them their own authority as long as they bent the knee to the Iron Throne. House Greyjoy was chosen and they became Lords of the Iron Islands.</p>
   <p>The Iron Islands are a collection of islands off the Western coast of Westeros in Ironman's Bay, located in the Sunset Sea. Their people which I have referred as ironmen or ironborn, are known to be harsh like the infertile lands they inhabit. They cannot grow their own crops or natual resources so they are forced to plunder the North, the Westerlands, or the Reach. Everything they own must be earned by what they refer to as the iron price. In the series we only get a glimpse of the major characters from House Greyjoy besides Theon and Yara(in the books she is Asha but they changed the name because it sounded too similar to another character). Balon, Theon's father had other brothers such as Aeron, a devout priest of the drowned god. They call him Damphair because he pretty much spends his entire life in the water blessing and annointing those who would become Ironborn. The priest who blesses Theon in season 2 is assumed to be Aeron but they never give that character a name in the show. Balon's second brother Victarion (pictured above with the giant battle axe) is a fearsome warrior sent by Euron to claim Daenerys as Eurons wife, but Victarion wants her for his own. In the picture Victarion is standing with a red priest of R'hllor named Moqorro (far left side) but many of the Ironborn can't pronounce his name so they refer to him as the "Black Flame". Moqorro sees great visions in the fire of the glory that awaits Victarion in Slaver's Bay. The third brother is Euron, who is pretty much a completely different character in the show vs the books. I will cover that more in another article because it needs to be addressed how awful his character is and not the sort of awful that George intended.</p> 

   <p>The Lords of the Iron Islands rule from the Seastone Chair, a throne made of black stone carved in the shape of a kraken. It was discovered fully intact on the island of Old Wyk when the First Men found the Iron Islands but now sits on the main seat at Pyke. There are no sources that can give credit to whoever built the Seastone Chair but it is heavily suggested that it was built by a premordial race of fish-men called the Deep Ones or by a race of men that came before the First Men. Either way, Aeron claims that only a godly man may sit upon the Seastone chair. The sigil of House Greyjoy is a golden kraken on a field of black and their words are "We do no Sow"</p>
